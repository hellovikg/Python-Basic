What is Python, and why is it popular\n","\n","- Python is a high-level, programming language known for its readability and versatility. It's popular due to its large standard library, extensive frameworks, and strong community support, making it suitable for web development, data science, AI, and more.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DWf1kBgQoeWA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python\n","\n","- An interpreter is a program that directly executes code line by line, without requiring it to be compiled into machine code first. Python uses an interpreter.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XYfI54DPqai6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n","\n","- Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, etc.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cTz2aj--qeuk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.

What is mutability in Python\n","\n","- Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can have their state modified in-place.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TyoAaVUhqmMs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n","\n","- Lists are mutable because their elements can be added, removed, or changed after creation. Tuples are immutable because their elements cannot be modified after creation.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"S5lJcbeTqpOg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n","\n","- The == operator checks for equality of values, while the is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dJSUS3P1qscq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python\n","\n","- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They are and, or, and not.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zzkxTf8mqvLM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n","\n","- Implicit type casting (coercion) is done automatically by Python when performing operations involving different data types. Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SOMHua9Nq2At"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n","\n","- Conditional statements (like if, elif, else) are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KFWsyiWEq4Ps"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. How does the elif statement work\n","\n","- The elif statement (short for 'else if') is used after an if statement to check additional conditions if the initial if condition is false. It allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated sequentially.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jDJh1hbKq644"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n","\n","- for loops are typically used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers. while loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uSh_oOVvq9rQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","- A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop should continue as long as a certain condition remains true.
