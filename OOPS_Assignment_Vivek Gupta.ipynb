    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from it. An object has a state (the values of its attributes) and behavior (the methods it can perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "-    Abstraction: Hiding complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "-    Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (a class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a key aspect of information hiding. Encapsulation is often used to achieve abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). They allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in operations and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In OOP, it refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading (though true method overloading as in some other languages is not a core feature of Python in the same way).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data and methods within a class. While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like `private` or `public` in the same way as Java or C++, conventions and name mangling (using double underscores before an attribute name, e.g., `__private_attribute`) are used to indicate that certain attributes or methods are intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, the constructor is a special method named `__init__`. It is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-    Class methods (`@classmethod`): These methods are bound to the class and receive the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named `cls`. They can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
    "-    Static methods (`@staticmethod`): These methods are not bound to the class or the instance. They don't receive a reference to the class or the instance as their first argument. They behave like regular functions but are defined within a class because they are logically related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class). However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments, variable-length arguments (`- args`, `kwargs`), or by checking the type of arguments within a single method.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the child class to provide a specific behavior for that method while still inheriting from the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `@property` decorator is a built-in Python decorator that provides a way to use methods as if they were attributes. It allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, providing more control over how attributes are accessed and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism is important because it allows for more flexible and extensible code. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of different types in a uniform way, reducing the need for conditional statements and making the code easier to maintain and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is intended to be a blueprint for other classes and often contains one or more abstract methods (methods declared but not implemented in the abstract class). In Python, you can create abstract classes using the `abc` module (`ABCMeta` and `@abstractmethod`).\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "-    Modularity: Objects are self-contained units, making code easier to manage and debug.\n",
    "-    Reusability: Inheritance allows code to be reused, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "-    Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for more flexible and adaptable code.\n",
    "-    Maintainability: Encapsulation and abstraction make code easier to understand and modify.\n",
    "-    Scalability: OOP principles can help manage complexity in large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "-    Class variable: A variable that is shared among all instances (objects) of a class. It is defined outside of any methods in the class.\n",
    "-    Instance variable: A variable that is unique to each instance (object) of a class. It is typically defined within the `__init__` method using `self.variable_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a class to combine the attributes and behaviors of multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    `__str__`: This method is called by the `str()` built-in function and by the `print()` function to compute the \"informal\" string representation of an object. It's intended to be readable for the end-user.\n",
    "-    `__repr__`: This method is called by the `repr()` built-in function to compute the \"official\" string representation of an object. It's intended to be unambiguous and should ideally be a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `super()` function is used to call methods of the parent class in a child class. It is particularly useful in the `__init__` method of a child class to call the parent class's constructor and initialize the parent's attributes. It's also essential in multiple inheritance to correctly resolve the method resolution order (MRO).\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__del__` method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected (when its reference count drops to zero). It's typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources. However, relying solely on `__del__` for cleanup can be unpredictable due to the nature of garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-    `@staticmethod`: Doesn't receive an implicit first argument (neither instance `self` nor class `cls`). It behaves like a regular function but is logically grouped within the class. It cannot access or modify instance or class state.\n",
    "-    `@classmethod`: Receives the class itself (`cls`) as the first argument. It is bound to the class and can access or modify class state (class variables). It's often used for alternative constructors or methods that operate on the class rather than a specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism with inheritance in Python is primarily achieved through method overriding. When a child class overrides a method from its parent, you can have a reference to an object of the child class but treat it as an object of the parent class. When the overridden method is called through the parent reference, the child class's implementation is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple method calls are made in a single expression. This is possible when each method in the chain returns an object, allowing the next method to be called on the returned object. In the context of OOP, this often involves methods that modify the object's state and then return `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. If a class implements the `__call__` method, you can create an object of that class and then use parentheses `()` after the object name to execute the code within the `__call__` method. This can be useful for creating objects that represent a function or a callable entity."
